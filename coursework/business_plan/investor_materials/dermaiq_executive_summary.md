# DermaIQ Executive Summary

## Company Overview

DermaIQ is an AI-powered skincare ingredient analysis platform that empowers consumers to make informed decisions about the products they apply to their skin. Founded by UCL graduates Jack Tan (Technical Lead) and Catherine Liang (UI/UX & Brand Design), DermaIQ leverages advanced computer vision, machine learning, and a comprehensive ingredient database to decode complex skincare ingredient labels and provide personalized recommendations based on individual skin profiles.

## The Problem

The skincare market is flooded with products containing complex ingredient lists that are difficult for consumers to understand:

2. **Analyzes** ingredients for safety, function, and potential concerns
3. **Personalizes** recommendations based on individual skin profiles
4. **Educates** users with accessible scientific information
5. **Recommends** safer alternatives when necessary

Our proprietary AI technology can recognize over 15,000 skincare ingredients with 98% accuracy and provide personalized compatibility assessments based on individual skin profiles.
