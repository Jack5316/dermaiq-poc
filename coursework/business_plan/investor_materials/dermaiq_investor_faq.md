# DermaIQ Investor FAQ

## Business Model

### Q: How does DermaIQ make money?
**A:** DermaIQ employs a multi-faceted revenue model:

1. **Consumer Revenue**:
   - Free tier with basic features and limited scans
   - Premium subscription at £3.99/month or £39.99/year (17% conversion rate in Year 1, scaling to 35% by Year 5)

2. **B2B Revenue**:
   - API licensing to retailers and beauty platforms
   - White-label solutions for skincare brands
   - Data insights for product manufacturers
   - Affiliate commissions from product recommendations

This diversified approach creates multiple growth vectors and reduces dependency on any single revenue stream.

### Q: What is your pricing strategy?
**A:** Our pricing strategy is designed to maximize user adoption while ensuring strong unit economics:

- **Free Tier**: Provides enough value to attract users but with strategic limitations that encourage upgrades
- **Premium Tier**: £3.99/month or £39.99/year, positioned below psychological price barriers while maintaining healthy margins
- **B2B Pricing**: Tiered based on usage volume, starting at £500/month for API access
- **White Label Solutions**: Custom pricing based on requirements, typically £10,000-50,000 setup plus ongoing licensing

We've validated this pricing through market research showing 68% of target users are willing to pay for personalized recommendations.

### Q: How do you plan to convert free users to paying customers?
**A:** Our conversion strategy includes:

1. **Value-Driven Limitations**: Free tier includes valuable functionality but with strategic limitations (scan limits, basic analysis)
2. **Personalization Gateway**: Users experience basic functionality, then are offered enhanced personalization with premium
3. **Progressive Engagement**: As users build their profiles and routines, the value of premium features increases
4. **Strategic Feature Placement**: Premium features are visible but gated, creating awareness and desire
5. **Time-Limited Trials**: Free premium trials at key moments in the user journey
6. **Targeted Promotions**: Personalized offers based on usage patterns and skin concerns

Our target is a 17% conversion rate in Year 1, growing to 35% by Year 5 as we enhance premium features and optimize conversion tactics.

## Exit Strategy

### Q: What are your potential exit opportunities?
**A:** DermaIQ presents several attractive exit opportunities:

1. **Strategic Acquisition**: Major beauty conglomerates (L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, Unilever) or tech companies (Apple, Google, Amazon) seeking to enhance their beauty-tech capabilities

2. **IPO**: Public offering once reaching significant scale (£50M+ annual revenue)

3. **Private Equity**: Secondary investment from PE firms focused on profitable growth-stage companies

Recent comparable exits in the beauty-tech space include:
- Perfect Corp (YouCam): $1B valuation
- Modiface: Acquired by L'Oréal (estimated $500M)
- Curology: $500M valuation in latest funding round

Our focus is on building sustainable value that would be attractive to multiple potential acquirers, rather than optimizing for a specific exit path.

### Q: What is your expected timeline to exit?
**A:** We anticipate a 5-7 year timeline to exit, with key milestones:

- **Years 1-2**: Establish product-market fit and initial growth
- **Years 3-4**: Scale user base and revenue; expand internationally
- **Years 5-7**: Achieve market leadership position; optimize for profitability

This timeline allows us to build substantial value while remaining aligned with typical venture capital investment horizons. However, we remain open to strategic opportunities that may arise earlier if they deliver exceptional value to shareholders.
