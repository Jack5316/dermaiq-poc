## Application to DermaIQ Project

The DermaIQ project incorporates principles and frameworks from these course materials in the following ways:

1. **Business Model Development**: Using the Business Model Canvas framework to structure the freemium model with basic free tier and premium subscription.

2. **Market Validation**: Applying survey methodologies learned from guest lectures to validate the market need (87% of surveyed consumers struggle to understand skincare ingredient labels).

3. **Technical Implementation**: Incorporating AI and technology insights from the HolisticAI materials into our ingredient analysis approach.

4. **Financial Planning**: Using the financial planning template to project revenue streams from the premium tier (£3.99/month) and additional sources.

5. **IP Protection**: Applying intellectual property strategies from Philip Treleaven's materials to protect our AI algorithms and database.

6. **Company Structure**: Planning the appropriate legal structure based on the "Basic Types of Companies" resource.

## Implementation in Python Scripts

The Python scripts developed for the DermaIQ project (ingredient_analysis.py, data_processing.py, and task_manager.py) implement concepts from the course materials, particularly:

- Data analysis techniques for market research validation
- Technical frameworks for AI implementation
- Methodologies for product development and testing

These scripts use NumPy, Pandas, and uv libraries as specified in the project requirements, and follow best practices for error handling and documentation.
