# DermaIQ: Decoding Skincare Ingredients with AI

## The Problem

Every day, consumers apply dozens of skincare ingredients to their bodies without understanding what they're putting on their skin. The average skincare product contains 15-50 ingredients, often listed with complex scientific names that are unintelligible to the average person. This lack of transparency creates significant challenges:

- **87%** of consumers struggle to understand ingredient labels
- **92%** are concerned about potentially harmful chemicals
- **76%** want better information about their skincare products
- **68%** would pay for personalized ingredient analysis

The skincare industry is projected to reach $189.3 billion globally by 2025, yet consumers remain largely in the dark about what they're purchasing and applying to their bodies.
