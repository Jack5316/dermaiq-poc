Don't care about 5. Data Visualization.
Use All MCPs in 8.Model Context Protocol (MCP)
1. **File Management**:
   - Create a `todo.md` file to manage tasks.
   - Use Python scripts for complex tasks.
   - Ensure Python 3.12 is installed for compatibility.

2. **Library Support**:
   - **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and data analysis.
   - **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
   - **uv**: Used for asynchronous I/O operations.
   - **Text Processing**: Supports various text formats, including Markdown and plain text.
   - **Image Processing**: Supports image formats like JPEG and PNG.
   - **Data Visualization**: Supports visualizing data using Dash.

3. **Task Management**:
   - Use the `todo.md` file to manage tasks.
   - Ensure tasks are clearly defined and prioritized.
   - Use Python scripts to automate task management.

4. **Scripting**:
   - Write Python scripts to automate tasks.
   - Ensure scripts are well-documented and tested.
   - Use libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data processing.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use Dash to create interactive dashboards.
   - Ensure data is accurately represented and easy to interpret.

6. **File Handling**:
   - Handle files in various formats, including text, images, and more.
   - Ensure files are properly organized and backed up.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling in scripts to ensure robustness.
   - Log errors for troubleshooting and improvement.

8. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:
   - use Fetch MCP to fetch data 
   - use Github MCP to fetch code
   - use Perplexity MCP to search
   - use Sequential Thinking MCP to think
   - use Memory MCP to remember
   - use Alpha-Vantage MCP to get finance data
   - use Tavily MCP to get news
