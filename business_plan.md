# DermaIQ Business Plan

## Executive Summary

DermaIQ is an AI-powered skincare ingredient analysis iOS application that provides consumers with reliable, transparent information about the products they put on their skin every day. Our solution helps users decode complex ingredient labels, identify potential harmful chemicals, and make informed decisions about their skincare products through a simple, intuitive interface backed by scientific data.

The global skincare market is projected to reach $189.3 billion by 2025, with the clean beauty segment growing at 12% annually. Our market research shows that 87% of consumers struggle to understand skincare ingredient labels, and 76% would use an app that helps decode these labels. DermaIQ addresses this significant market need through advanced computer vision technology, machine learning, and a comprehensive ingredient database.

Operating on a freemium business model, DermaIQ offers a basic free tier with limited scans and a premium subscription at £3.99/month providing unlimited scans, personalized recommendations, and product comparisons. Additional revenue streams include B2B API access, anonymized market research data, and affiliate marketing.

With an initial seed funding of £250,000, DermaIQ aims to launch in Q3 2025, targeting 50,000 users in the first year with 10% conversion to paid subscribers. By year three, we project 500,000 users, 100,000 paid subscribers, and annual revenue of £5.5 million.

## 2. Problem and Solution

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Consumers face significant challenges when trying to understand skincare product ingredients:

1. **Complex Terminology**: Ingredient labels use scientific names that are difficult for average consumers to understand (e.g., "Butyrospermum Parkii" instead of "Shea Butter").

2. **Lack of Transparency**: Limited information about potential risks or benefits of specific ingredients, with manufacturers often using vague marketing terms like "natural" or "clean."

3. **Information Overload**: Too much conflicting information online about skincare ingredients, making it difficult to determine what's reliable.

4. **Time-Consuming Research**: Researching each ingredient manually is impractical for most consumers, especially when standing in a store making a purchase decision.

5. **Personalization Gap**: Generic information doesn't account for individual skin types or conditions, leading to potentially inappropriate product choices.

1. **Scans Product Labels**: Uses computer vision to identify ingredients from product packaging
